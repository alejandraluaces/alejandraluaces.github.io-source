      <p>Kudos for publishing Dan Braum's comprehensive railroad safety article ["Derailed," February 2013]. It provided a prespective that is easily lost when the events involved are widely dispersed in time and place.</p>

      <p>Railroads are by far the safest, most efficient, and most environmentally friendly mode of transportation.  Why not do a story on 18-wheelers? Studies have shown that if big trucks paid road-use taxes commensurate with the expense of maintaining roads due to truck traffic, much of the freightthat goes by truck would go by rail instead.  That cargo could be shipped more safely, more cheaply, and with less environmental impact.</p>

          <p>Most definitely an advanced robot.  I would not want other humans to risk their lives.</p>

        <strong>We Apologize . . .</strong> The Sony BOV-N790W magnetic fluid speakers on page 14 of the January issue have a frequency range of 200 Hz-20kHz, not 87.5 MHz-108MHz.  On page 52 of the February Issue, the train that derailed near Philidelphia International Airport was operated by Conrail, not CSX.
