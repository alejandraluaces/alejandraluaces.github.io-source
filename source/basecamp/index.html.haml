    %p The first time my mother saw me, she called me Chispa, or “little spark” in Spanish. That moniker not only stuck, but also may have had a hand in determining my fate. My existence has been anything but ordinary.

    %p I consider myself lucky. As a kid, I looked to the outdoors as my sole source of entertainment, learning, and wisdom. Mimicking my carpenter father, I built things from random supplies and objects around my home including a fort, a sled for my dog to pull me around on, and a bug palace for the resident roly polies. Despite the sometimes gross nature of my leisure activities, they allowed me to develop an  entrepreneurial spirit. I was always dreaming, doing, innovating.

    %p Hungry for knowledge, hungry for experience, and sometimes just hungry for food.
    %p My background is unique and varied for many reasons, the most important of which is that I am hungry. Insatiable, really.
    %p I have been everything from a legal assistant to a biologist (my degree is in Interdisciplinary Zoological Sciences) to an artist to a molecular gastronomist to a triathlete, to now, a designer. I am a researcher at heart, and am never satisfied until I get to the bottom of something. I am relentless.
    %p Working on the web is the perfect place for me to seek nourishment, because the internet is always growing, changing, evolving – and I am too, right along with it.

    %p I bought a one-way ticket to Chicago last year after living my entire life in Florida. I used to play with alligators and venomous snakes for fun (and for work). I’ve engaged in passionate debates with clients about the shittiness of requiring binary gender choice in their forms. I guess you could say I’m practically fearless.

    %p Compared to other applicants, my time in the tech industry is relatively short. Admitting that is scary, sure. I think inexperience is a great thing. Since I am a passionate and quick learner, relatively unafraid, and pretty scrappy, getting up to speed on things won’t be a problem. I don’t have years of battle scars informing my every decision, or traumas to undo.
    %p I am here to advocate for users and win hearts and minds for a cause I’m passionate about. That’s it.

    %p I have something to admit. I’ve never actually used Basecamp.
    %p I know, I know, it’s terrible. Why am I even applying? But hear me out:
    %p Basecamp is a huge name in my little world. Not because of revenue or prestige or even really reputation.
    %p Basecamp is noteworthy because of the talented, hardworking, forward-thinking people behind the product.
    %p Basecampers are ballsy. Basecampers go after what they want, despite obstacles that might be in their way. Basecampers use their successes as their guide, but understand that failure is a natural part of the process.

      %h2 what is this about?
      %p It’s my application to Basecamp. Children’s stories inspire me–something about the innocence, the whimsical nature, the gentleness of them. I modeled my application after a children’s story. I wanted it to feel ethereal. I wanted it to inspire a sense of wonder, while delivering relevant information about what I bring to the table.

      %h2 who are you?
      %p Well, if you hadn’t gleaned from the text above, I’m Alejandra Luaces-Riera. It’s okay if you can’t pronounce it on the first try. I moved to Chicago from Florida a year and a half ago. I’m currently a designer at Table XI, but looking for my next work-home.

      %h2 but table xi is great!
      %p Yes, I agree! However, it’s getting to be a bit tough iterating on other people’s dreams, sending them off into the wild, and never hearing from them again. Table XI is a great place to work and grow, but it isn’t the right fodder for my soul.

      %h2 why marketing design?
      %p I’ve been focusing on product design for the entirety of my career in tech. I love what I do, but something is missing. To me, meaningful work is writing copy that makes someone feel I'm speaking directly to them. It’s having the creative freedom to inspire people to laugh, think twice, and want to discover more.
